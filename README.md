# js-library-template

A template for writing next awesome JavaScript library.

## Features

- documentation generating with `jsdoc` with `docdash` template (may be replaced if something better comes in my way)
- unit tests with `mocha` & `must.js`
- es6+ first approach, with es5 transpiled version to be found inside `dist` folder *
- Keep-a-changelog CHANGELOG format as an example of good practice and reminder to write change logs
- Rewire plugin for easy testing with mocks
- Eslint integration with strict rules by default

\* - transpiling kills JS engines optimizations, makes codes longer and tree shaking harder to do and/or slower

## To be done

- Task runner
